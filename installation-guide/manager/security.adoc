== External Keycloak Authentication

The apiman quickstart overlay ZIP comes with an embedded version of Keycloak that we use for authentication.
You may already have a Keycloak instance that you use.
This section explains how to modify apiman to use yours instead of ours.

=== Create the apiman Realm in Keycloak

You'll need to make sure you create the *apiman* realm in your Keycloak server.
A quick way to do that is to use the Keycloak admin console to import the apiman realm file located here:

https://github.com/apiman/apiman/blob/master/distro/data/src/main/resources/data/apiman-realm.json

=== Configure the API Manager UI client in Keycloak

Once the apiman realm has been created or imported, make sure to configure the *Valid Redirect URIs* section of the *apimanui*, *apiman* and *apiman-gateway-api* clients.
The default relative URL of each must be replaced by the full (absolute) public URL of your API Manager UI.

For example, the values may be something like:

    apimanui:: `https://apiman.myorg.com/apimanui/*`
    apiman:: `https://apiman.myorg.com/apiman/*`
    apiman-gateway-api:: `https://apiman.myorg.com/apiman-gateway-api/*`

TIP: Don't forget the "*" wildcard at the end of the URL.

=== Point apiman at the remote Keycloak

Finally, you must modify the *standalone-apiman.xml* configuration file to point apiman at the remote Keycloak server.

Make sure you know the full public URL of your Keycloak server and add it to the following section of *standalone-apiman.xml*:

```xml
<realm xmlns:kc="urn:jboss:domain:keycloak:1.0" name="apiman">
    <realm-public-key>MIIBIjAN<...>AQAB</realm-public-key>
    <auth-server-url>http://apiman.myorg.com:8080/auth</auth-server-url>
    <public-client>true</public-client>
    <ssl-required>NONE</ssl-required>
    <enable-cors>false</enable-cors>
    <principal-attribute>preferred_username</principal-attribute>
</realm>
```

TIP: If you manually created the apiman realm in Keycloak, you will also need to copy the realm's public key into <realm-public-key> above.
